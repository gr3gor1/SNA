## Description
- In this project we had to analyze different kinds of topologies so as to observe the different characteristics per type using Networkx library. 

- Initially we analyzed the different clustering coefficients and node eccentricity metrics per type. 

- Next we had to analyze the different kinds of centrality per type (e.g. degree centrality, katz centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality). 

- Also we applied the PageRank algorithm on a real-world topology to observe its output and then we analyzed the robustness and connectivity per different type of graph. 

- Then we analyzed how REG topologies react when g value increases (REG-->SW-->RG(ER)). 

- Finally after analyzing data from a real-world network we had to classify the topology.

The initial graphs REG, RG(ER), SW, SF ,RGG were created using Networkx functions with specific parameters.
