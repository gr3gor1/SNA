This project consists of three parts:

- In the first part we had to find the node degree distribution and mean node degree for three real-world topologies. Also we had to find the clustering coefficient distribution, mean clustering coefficient, closeness centrality and mean closeness centrality per graph. Then using as a baseline the REG, RGG, RG(ER), SF and SW topologies we had to classify the three graphs accordingly. Finally we visualized all the graphs mentioned above.

- In the second part we used three different communities detection algorithms on the partitions with biggest modularity score and performance score per graph. The algorithms used are :

  1. Spectral Clustering
  2. Newman Girvan
  3. Greedy Modularity Communities

- In the third and latest part we had to compare the periods of time, the modularity scores and performance scores of each algorithm per graph and then visualize the corresponding communities.
